# bacteria_metabolimics_MB39_137
This repository was created in order to ease the access to public data of spectra and pipeline description of research work made for a metabolomics study involving two strains of bacteria

#How to navigate:
Public data sets of the feature peak lists of both bacteria strains B. gladioli and S. proteamaculans was made available at: massive-ftp.ucsd.edu/v11/MSV000100425/

/mass_files/: this folder will give access to all the files correlated to spectra alignment and metabolite annotation files (including SIRIUS annotation raw files and MZmine files).

/R_tools/: this folder will give access to files regarding scripts and pipelines constructed in R software such as Statistical analysis and MS data manipulation.
